The SysML v2 Pilot-Implementation contains a parser for this textual notation.</p> <p>We know from the definition of programming languages, that it is, however, helpful to provide a second source parser, such that parsing results can be compared and therefore compilers, linters, checkers of context conditions and other advanced tooling, receive the level of quality desired for industrial use.</p> <ul> <li> <p> Getting Started</p> <p>Is this your first time using SysML?
