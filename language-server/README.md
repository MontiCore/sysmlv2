# SysML v2 Syntax Support

Editor-agnostic, state-of-the-art syntax support for SysML v2 textual notation.
Provides contextual syntax highlighting of keywords, auto-completion, navigation
between usages and definitions, error reporting, and hints.

This tool build's on [Microsoft's Language Server Protocol (LSP)][lsp], a
protocol that's used between an editor or IDE and a language server that
provides language features like auto complete, go to definition, find all
references etc. Our language server is automatically generated from our [SysML
v2 language implementation][language] via the MontiCore Language Server
Generator (MCLSG).

Compared to the [pilot implementation's syntax support][sst], our implementation
* **is editor-agnostic**, i.e., any editor supporting the Language Server
  Protocol can connect to our server to provide rich syntax support.
* **provides a single implementation** usable across different editor, no need
  for re-implementation for each editor/IDE.
* **enabled the most advanced analytics**, contextual highlighting,
  expression support, and is fully extendable. No need to define non-contextual
  keyword-lists or give up go-to-definition and contextual hints.

## Download and Usage

You can use our language server with any LSP-compatible editor or IDE. Try out
installing our integrated **VSCode Plugin** to get going the fastest:

1. [**Download** the latest version][download]
2. **Install** by simply dragging the downloaded VSIX-file into the extensions
   view in VSCode
3. **Done**! Now create or open a text file with the ending `.sysml`:
