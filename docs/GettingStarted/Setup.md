# Setup SysML v2

SysML v2 runs on any platform. In the following tutorials, we will use the CLI.


#### Run the CLI

To run the CLI manually, you need to have [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) installed.
Next, download the [SysML v2 Tool jar](https://www.monticore.de/download/MCSysMLv2.jar).

You can then run the tool with:

```bash
java -jar MCSysMLv2.jar
```

exemplary usage:

```
java -jar MCSysMLv2.jar -h
java -jar MCSysMLv2.jar -i Car.sysml -pp
```

You can find detailed descriptions and available parameters in the [usage](../Usage/index.md) section.
